# Audio Sanitizer

**Audio Sanitizer** is a simple tool designed to clean up audio files by removing silent sections, making sure the final output maintains smooth transitions between non-silent sections. The tool intelligently handles fade-ins and fade-outs, preventing the audio from sounding too choppy when silence is removed. Whether you're working with podcasts, lectures, or regular audio files, this tool helps optimize your audio content for a more polished listening experience.

> **Note**: This tool is currently in the early stages of development. It is optimized for **.mp3** files and is only supported on **Windows** at this time.

- **Customization Options**: Adjust the silence detection threshold, minimum silence length, and fade durations to suit your needs.
- **File Management**: Automatically generates unique filenames to avoid overwriting existing files and allows you to save the processed audio in a designated output folder.
